# FastAPI Docker Template

This repository serves as a template for building a FastAPI application and containerizing it with Docker.  It provides a basic structure to get you started quickly.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # You'll need to create this file
    ```

5.  **Create a `.env` file:**

    Copy the `.env.example` (if provided) and rename it to `.env`.  Update the values with your specific configurations.  This file will store environment variables for your application.

6.  **Run the application locally (for development):**

    ```bash
    #  The specific command will depend on your FastAPI setup.  
    #  For example, if you use Uvicorn:
    uvicorn main:app --reload  
    ```

7.  **Build the Docker image:**

    ```bash
    docker build -t my-fastapi-app .
    ```

8.  **Run the Docker container:**

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8000 my-fastapi-app
    ```

    This will start the application and make it accessible on port 8000 of your host machine.

## Project Structure

*   `app/`:  (Likely) Contains your FastAPI application code (e.g., `main.py`, `routers`, `models`).
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python packages required for your application.
*   `Dockerfile`: Defines the steps to build your Docker image.
*   `.env`: Stores environment variables (not committed to the repository).
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore (e.g., virtual environment, `.env` file).

## Key Considerations

*   **FastAPI:**  This template uses FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
*   **Docker:** Docker is used to package your application and its dependencies into a container, ensuring consistency across different environments.
*   **Environment Variables:**  Use environment variables (stored in the `.env` file) to manage configuration settings (database URLs, API keys, etc.) securely.  **Never commit sensitive information directly to the repository.**
*   **Virtual Environments:**  Always work within a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies.
